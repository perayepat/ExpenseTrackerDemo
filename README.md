From the tutorial, i plan on adding menu's, options and being able to customise this app as your own 

## Current Features 
**Jason retrieval**
**Automatic JSON updates**
**Graph View**
**Transaction View**

## Planned Features
**Side menu**
**Investment View**
**Profile Customisation**
**Bank Card View**

## Challenges
SwiftUi layout is similar but completley different from web dev
Importing and formatting JSON was really trying 
Working with 3rd party plugins to get them working right
